Assignment 2

In this assignment we were asked to create a Caesar cypher app  that will take input and encrypt or decrypt a phrase.

I divided my code in 4 parts:

1. The welcoming: in this part I wanted to welcome the user and explaining what the Caesar cypher was. After that, I print the instructions to the user of what this program will ask, what they will need to input and what not.
2. The input section: in this part I created three while loops for each input: Phrase, key, and Operation. I created these to make sure that the characters input from the user were not erroneous, in order to prevent runtime errors and handle special cases. 
3. The shifter: for this part of the code I took the example that was given in the class and make the respectives changes in order to work with my code. The example given was written with python 2, so io had to change, add and remove some part of this in order to make it work. this section will take the input from the user and shift the phrase depending of the key number input by the user.
4. The Output: this section will print the input that was asked by the user and the encrypted or decrypted solution. lastly it will ask the user if they want to run the program again.
